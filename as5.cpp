/*A pizza delivery company wants to optimize its delivery process to minimize its delivery time and fuel cost.
The company has a central pizza hub where all pizzas are prepared. Multiple delivery locations exist where customers 
are waiting for their orders. A road network connects the hub to all delivery locations, with each road segment 
having a specific dist or travel time. The goal is to determine the shortest path from the pizza hub to each 
customer location so that deliveries can be made as quickly and efficiently as possible.*/
